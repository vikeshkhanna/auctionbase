Check out our About Me Page , where you can find out about us and read the recent articles about our company in Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail, Washington Post and our appearence on CNN. Beautifully engraved certificate from the Hertz Corporation issued in 1976-1977. This historic document was printed by the Security-Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of an allegorical man and woman sitting beside the company's logo. This item has the printed signatures of the company_s chairman (Robert L. Stone) and vice-president,finance and assistant secretary. This bond is over 34 years old. Hertz, the world's leading vehicle renting organization, is represented in over 140 countries, operating a fleet of 525,000 vehicles from approximately 6,500 locations. The pioneer of auto renting was Walter L. Jacobs who in September of 1918, at the age of 22, opened a car-rental operation in Chicago. Starting with a dozen Model T Fords, which he repaired and repainted himself, Jacobs expanded his operation to the point where, within five years, the business generated annual revenues of about $1 million. In 1923, Jacobs sold his car-rental concern to John Hertz, President of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Jacobs continued as Hertz' top operating and administrative executive. This rental business, called Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, was acquired in 1926 by General Motors Corporation when it bought Yellow Truck from John Hertz. The Hertz Corporation In 1953, the Hertz properties were bought from GMC by the Omnibus Corporation, which divested itself of its bus interest and concentrated solely on car and truck renting and leasing. A year later, a new name was taken -- The Hertz Corporation -- and it was listed for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Jacobs became Hertz' first President and served in that post until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1985 at the age of 88. In 1954, the new corporation bought Metropolitan Distributors, a pioneer in New York truck leasing dating back to World War I and the largest concern of its kind in any one city. In the process, the head of Metropolitan, Leon C. Greenbaum, became Vice Chairman of the Hertz Board of Directors; he later became Chairman, and in 1960, Chief Executive Officer. In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA Corporation and operated as a separate entity, with its own management and Board of Directors. In 1985, Hertz joined UAL, Inc. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to Park Ridge Corporation, a company formed by Ford Motor Company and Hertz management, for the purpose of purchasing Hertz. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation joined Ford and Hertz management as an investor in Park Ridge Corporation. In 1993, Park Ridge Corporation was merged into The Hertz Corporation. In 1994, Ford purchased the outstanding shares of Hertz and Hertz became an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of The Ford Motor Company. On April 25, 1997, Hertz became a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol &quot;HRZ.&quot; Hertz Today Hertz is headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Its current headquarters location opened in 1988. Prior to that the corporation was based in New York and, before that, Chicago. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is the site of Hertz' Worldwide Reservations Center and Data Center, established in 1970, and its Financial Center, established in 1994. Car rentals, the largest and best known of Hertz' activities, are conducted from more than 1,600 domestic, corporate and licensee locations, and approximately 4,500 corporate and licensee locations outside the United States. Hertz offers a wide variety of current-model cars on a short-term rental basis -- daily, weekly or monthly -- at airports, in downtown and suburban business centers, and in residential areas and resort locales. Today, Hertz' Worldwide Reservations System handles approximately 40 million phone calls and delivers in total approximately 30 million reservations annually This Authentic certificate looks great framed and is much nicer in person than the scan indicates.

One is a ballerina with a pink and red dress. Another is a bartender with a big mustache mixing a drink. There is a man in his green pajamas (I think) holding his head with stars swimming around his head (possibly a headache). Next is a couple of drunks sitting by a lamppost. And the last two are the same of a dancer with a top hat sitting on a stool with a drink in his hand. These appear to be for a bar. I'm not sure how the ballerina fits into the picture. There is one other coaster that came with the set that is being listed seperately. It is a black man playing a saxaphone. If you are interested in it be sure to look at my auction. But note it will end a day earlier than this group. Also there is a coaster with no character that I will throw in if the winning bidder wants it. They need to let me know. These coasters are really, really cute. They are in great shape with no chips or cracks. The colors are very bright and nothing missing. There are some brown spots here and there, but you have to have them in good light to see the spots. I really believe the winning bidder is going to love them! There is no reserve. The buyer will be responsible for shipping charges and insurance if requested. I need to hear from you within 3 days after auction ends. Payment must be received within 10 days.

A quick word to our long time friends and customers as well as new: Other eBay dealers sell hose and other items, but not too many take the time to give you a good description and, perhaps, a little history, tips, etc...... We thank all of you who have taken the time to view, bid on and win our auctions! As always, we're happy to answer your questions about hosiery or any of our items. You can pay for this auction with: Money Order, Personal Check (will send you the item when it clears), With Your Visa Or MasterCard in the U.S. You Can Use PayPal. PayPal is now available around the world. Click on the PayPal logo below or visit them at: http://www.paypal.com, or, If You're An International Bidder, You Can Use Bid Pay To Send A Western Union Money Order In U.S. DOLLARS! They are at http://www.bidpay.com And now a quick word about our rules of the road. Please Take 2 Minutes To Read This And Avoid Delays Or Misunderstandings: 1.) Please Pay For Your Item Within 5 Days. If You're Having An Emergency Or A Problem, Let Us Know, We'll Work With You. Items not paid for in the specified time may be withheld from the non-paying bidder and may relisted. 2.) Non-paying Bidders Will Receive A Non-Paying Bidders Notice To eBay And Face Negative Feedback, And Ultimately Termination Of Their eBay Account If They Make A Habit Of Not Paying For Auctions. 3.) All Sales Final Unless Otherwise Marked So Please Ask Any Questions Before You Bid. 4.) If You Win More Than One Item Within 24 Hours, Please Be Sure To Let Us Know, So You Can Enjoy Combined Shipping And Save Money 5.) Please Include A Copy Of The Notification Letter With Your Payment For Fastest Service, Whether You Pay By PayPal Or Snail Mail. If You Don't Please Be Sure To Include The eBay Auction Number For Each Item, As Well As A Small Description Of Your Item(s) For The Fastest Service! 6.) Unlike A Majority Of Dealers On eBay We Leave You Feedback A.S.A.P. After Receiving Your Payment. We Would Appreciate Positive Feedback From You If You're Happy With Your Item When You Receive It. 7.) All Money Order or Check Payments MUST be drawn on a U.S. Bank, in U.S. Dollars. For example: A Money Order From The Royal Canadian Bank in U.S. Dollars is NOT accepted, not because we don't like Canadians, but because our bank imposes a hefty fee for such money orders. Canadian and European customers are encouraged to use PayPal or Bid Pay for payments. 8.) If you pay with PayPal and you have won multiple items, PLEASE make only 1 PayPal Payment and include all the auction numbers on the one payment. It simplifies it for you and for me. Also, PayPal charges a transaction fee for EACH payment made, in addition to their OTHER fees to the seller. We combine shipping to save you money - please combine multiple auction PayPal payments into ONE to help keep our costs low, so we can KEEP providing Lower Cost combined shipping.... A quick check of our feedback will show you that nearly every other buyer buys from us more than once!! Also, a larger percentage of our feedback centers on our FAST SHIPPING!!! Are you tired of paying for an item and waiting for 2 weeks? Not with Kathy's Nostalgiabilia. We get your money on Monday, and your item goes out by Wednesday or sooner if possible!! Our shipping rates are still among the best on eBay, even with the recent rise in rates in the Post Office. For up to 4 pairs of stockings: In the U.S $2.50; Canada: $2.75; Europe: $3.75. If you win other than hosiery items, Please See Listing For Actual Shipping Rate, or buyer is responsible for reasonable shipping rate. Believe me, ours are among the best shipping rates on eBay!! Our feedback profile is proof we deliver, however, we are not responsible for loss of goods in the mail that are not insured. Insurance is extra and based on total. Insured items go out once a week: Monday. Non-insured items go out a.s.a.p. upon receipt of payment. Kathy's Nostalgia Guarantees Every Item To Be As Described Or Your Money Back!

Has pinup/poster back page. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping.

Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping.

Plate number 4944A is the fourth of this series. This sculpture plate captures a 3-D image of merry little angles singing &amp; playing musical instruments in this special Christmas collection. Not only is each plate in lifelike three-dimension, but each contains a music box that plays the beloved Christmas carol featured at the turn of a key. The detail is superb, and each plate has bright cheerful holiday colors. The texture and proportions of each object are perfectly captured from the original sculpture. This 5 plate series of charming hand-crafted art recalls the joys of Christmas. The plate is approximately 6 inches in diameter, is in mint condition, has never been displayed, and comes in the original packaging with certificate of authenticity. Each plate has a clasp on the back of the plate so that it can be hung on the wall and a small built in base so it can stand upright on its own. The plates originally sold for $44 directly from Bradford Exchange. This plate will make a great Christmas gift. I HAVE ALL FIVE PLATES FROM THIS SERIES AND WILL LIST THEM ALL. Winning bid can pay by BillPoint, PayPal, money order, or check. Please allow 5 days for personal checks to clear before I ship the item. PLEASE SUBMIT PAYMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER AUCTION HAS CLOSED. I pack the items carefully; however, I cannot be held responsible for lost or broken items. Buyer can purchase insurance for an extra $1.10 to $3.00 depending on the value of the shipment. Shipping is by Priority Mail. The plates are easily twice to three times the weight of a typical Bradford Exchange plate so shipping 1 plate is $6.45; 2 plates are $8.35 and 3 plates are $10.00. I try to give an accurate description of the condition so you know what you are purchasing. Please feel free to E-mail me prior to bidding if you have any questions. Will do my best to get the plates out as fast as possible, but shipping during the holidays can be slow. Thank you for looking. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER PLATES LISTED ABOVE NEXT TO Bigdawg85.

Please read all stipulations below, if you cannot honor or abide by them, do not waste our time or yours. We do not enjoy giving negatives or receiving threatening mail about an impending negative or non paying bidder process, but to be fair we have guidelines that we follow and make perfectly clear in our auctions. I really regret having to implement these stipulations in our auctions, but irresponsible bidders and timewasters have made it necessary. Those buyers who do not seem to understand that we do not take checks also have made this necessary. For those of you who are responsible bidders, who read the entire auction before they bid, please know that this is not aimed at you and that we welcome you and your purchase. I have met a lot of really nice courteous bidders and sellers here and hope to keep meeting you all in the future. For you repeat buyers, thank you for your trust in me and I really do value your business. 1. we use a set shipping and insurance fee . This fee will take in oversize boxes if this pertains to the auction, and delivery confirmation and insurance on all items. It does also include a handling fee in the amount which will take care of our expenses in getting the item to you safe and sound, extra insurance and sales tax. We try very hard to be as close to the shipping and insurance as we can,but still allow extra for the above. Shipping will be on the Saturday after payment is recieved. Shipping will be by Priority mail insurance , delivery confirmation and handling fee will mean a total shipping price of 6.50 for this item. non US bidders will need to pay more. Please contact us to make sure that we mail to your country before you bid and to check out the shipping and insurance costs. There are some countries that do not allow insurance and therefore we are not able to send to this country. 2. . I do reserve the right to not accept bids from those with negative feed-back ; history of non payment; late payments; lack of communications or unreasonable demands or retractions. If you snipe at the last minute, we will hold to these same standards and may not honor your bid for the same reasons. All bidders are held to the same standards to be fair. Regardless of feedback or buyer/seller status. 3. Payment is fine money order or cashier check. We are no longer taking checks. If you send a check, it will NOT be considered payment and will either be destroyed or returned with your merchandise upon proper payment. We also take paypal payments from verified accounts which unfortunately does not include other countries at present. You would send to momahedger@aol.com. 4. We do participate in the NPB process. 5. I leave feedback when I know that the buyer has recieved their item. I do not need for the buyer to leave it first, but I do need to know that the item has arrived. I rate my buyers on their payment, on their communication with us during and after the auction and their reading and following our guidelines in the auction. Many sellers do it different. As soon as I know that the item has arrived I will go and leave feedback . Ruby Lane Antiques &amp; Collectibles

MY WEB ADDRESS IS: CLASSICCOMICINVESTMENTS.COM PHONE(347)-672-3878FLASH #12 Please read this in full. MY NAME IS JOSEPH SERPICO. I belive the books and the free market speak for themselves (IN MOST CASES), so why thrust a imaginary support level on the auction? The cgc census report is now avalable on their web site, cgccomics.com (as of 7-12-01). I strongly encourage all serious bidders to visit this site, especially when bidding on more expensive or scarce books. Many of the books I offer up on ebay and on my website are of the highest slabbed grades at present, or in a good number of times-the ONLY book of it's kind to have been graded. This information is powerful when buying, selling or bidding. I am a CGC Charter member, and AACC member. My grading is guaranteed,-refering to unslabbed books, naturally- I have been a collector and seller/dealer for over 35 years. Many references available, if you need them. If not satisfied I will return a full refund for the books, as long as they are returned in original condition. All items packed securely. Shipping is $6 in the Cont.USA. Insurance is extra-$2 and up-(for merchadise $100 or more) depending on price of book, and I will not be responsible for uninsured books(anything over $100). I usually ship ONCE a week depending on volume, (sometimes more), using either USPS-priority mail, OR Fed Ex ground, either takes 2-4 days. All CGC books are non returnable, I will warrenty against any cracks in the slab, though. Most (USPS) books sent by certified. Overseas postage is at LEAST $15 per package, so please keep this in mind if you are bidding from overseas, or just please refrain from bidding. Also, most bidders are honorable, but do not bid if you are unsure that you can make payment and agree to terms. For USA orders, you may combine up to 5 CGC books and up to 12 non CGC books per order. Thanks for looking, have fun, and please visit my web site and other auctions.

The bottle has beveled everything: vertical edges, shoulders, and sloping, beveled shoulder corners. It appears to be an early bottle, with a large pontil (equally large imperfection next to the pontil), tons of wear on the base, and a somewhat rough exterior (made that way). Large, inside bubble on the shoulder. Very small chip where the vertical edge meets the base. Ground mouth, to accomodate the ground stopper. By the way, the stopper has concentric rays on top, fairly fancy. The stopper is slightly hazy, with a tiny nick on the edge. Low opening bid of $5.00, and if you get it for that price, you've done well. The buyer pays $5.00 shipping, via Priority Mail. Insurance, if desired, is extra. Thanks and good luck.

It is a Ceramic candle holder of a mouse cuddled up in an xmas stocking, next to a pot belly stove. The candle holder comes with a candle but as can be seen in the photos, heat has caused it to curve a bit and it received a scratch that has removed some of the red color. The candle holder itself is in excellent condition. While it has never been used, you will find some candle shaving in it as I pushed the candle in for the pictures. The box has been in storage for several years but as it was on the top, it is still in excellent condition with it's full gloss.. If you are interested in figural Avon Decanters/bottles be sure to look at the other items offered as I have several others up for bids. High bidder to pay shipping and insurance. If you decline the insurance, please understand that if the item gets lost or damaged during shipment, you accept that responsibility with no recourse for reimbursement.

Digger Odell states in his book, Pontil Medicine Encyclopedia, that Perry Davis was a carpenter and discovered this formula and began selling this medicine in a basket-What a change in occupations. Digger does not list this size either. This medicine was also referred to in the classic novel of Tom Sawyer. The condition is good-it is dug with a nice haze. No chips, dings or cracks in the glass. The glass is crude and has wonderful whittle. The base is the real odd feature-has a horseshoe type key mold, an x on each side with a nice open pontil in the center.

You are getting the aluminum press, 12 cookie plates and 3 pastry tips, and an instruction/recipe book. This is in very good condition -- looks like it was never used. All the pieces fit down into a styrofoam base and there is a box bottom only -- I think a lid of some type is missing, but the base fits over the styrofoam. If you are planning to make holiday Spritz cookies -- this is just what you need! NO RESERVE! Buyer agrees by bidding to pay $5.20 for shipping in the U.S. Most likely, the shipping quote is priority mail through the USPS, but I also use first class, or media mail if appropriate. Insurance is optional at $1.10 for the first $50. coverage. If you opt to not have insurance it is understood that you are shipping at your own risk. If I have not given a quote above it is because this weighs more than 5 lbs. wrapped and the costs vary depending on where you live -- You can get an exact quote by going to the postal website at www.usps.gov -- my zip code is 48167. I cannot ship UPS. International rates will be higher -- write me for a quote before you bid if you are concerned about the cost. Bid on more than one item to save shipping costs!! ALL THE FINE PRINT: Personal checks, money orders, PayPal, Billpoint or Bidpay are accepted. I make every effort to ship as soon as possible with any type of payment.

I built up a 550+ feedback rating while working with Socko! Comics. Now I am starting over on my own, but that means starting with a feedback of zero. Read my Honesty Policy below. NM 1970 ASTONISHING TALES 1 - 8 : KAZAR &amp; DR DOOM QUESTIONS: click here to send an e-mail CONDITION : NEAR MINT OPENING BID: $9.99 HOW TO PAY? MONEY ORDER &amp; PAYPAL HOW TO SHIP? I ship via United States Postal Service for both domestic and international. You pay only the cost required to ship. I do not believe in padding auctions by adding unjustified extra charges. I don't like it when people do it to me, so I won't do it to you. PICTURES: Click on each to get a larger view. _ #1 #7 HONESTY POLICY I have met people in my store who won books on E-Bay that were nowhere near the condition described. It angers me as a seller because it ruins the reputations of dealers as a whole. Simply put, it hurts our market by driving away customers. How Do I Grade? I look at every book and grade it according to six categories: front cover, back cover, corners, edges, spine &amp; staples, interior pages. I give a complete description of each of these sections noting any flaws or defects. Also, I include large scans of the front and back covers. When I have completed the auction page, I am satisfied that you know exactly what you are bidding on and that there will be no surprises at auction's end. So what about returns? At first I offered returns on books. Then I quickly discovered that some people would outbid everyone else by an excessively high amount just to get a look at the book, then ask for a return if they decided they didn't want it. I no longer offer returns. I am confident in my grading and description and have never had a complaint about either. If you are not sure that you want the book then don't bid on it. COMPLETE DESCRIPTION: _ All books have come from the same collection and have received the same care over the years. Title: Astonishing Tales Featuring Kazar and Dr. Doom Issue(s) &amp; Date(s): #1, August 1970 - #8, October 1971 Double feature books. Issues feature work by Kirby, Wood and Barry Smith.

Included are issues: 111,112,116,123,124,126,127,128,129,130,131,133,134,136,137,140,141,142,143,145,146,148,149,151,152,153,155, and #200.. Plus Incredible Hulk Special #4. All are in BEAUTIFUL condition.. really nice comics. The only exception to this would be Issue # 200 which has some dark scuffing amidst the white background. Amazing the newest one is the worst.. and even it's prob at least a Fine grade comic. I believe issue 141 is the first appearance of Doc Samson.. saw it on here for about $50 all by itself and prob not as good as this one.. It looks about perfect to me. Issues 123,124,129,130, and 131 have store date stamps on the light part of the covers.. but nothing major.. other than that they appear to be NM. It would take me forever to look at each and every page of this many comics but the few I opened and checked only showed to be a little off-white around the edges.. and near the center. Nothing out of the ordinary for a 30 year old comic. Saw no creases or any other obvious blemishes.. other than those with the store dates. All are bagged and boarded.. and rather than risk damaging them in scans I chose to scan them in the covers so if you see a little &quot;shimmer&quot; .. it's the scan... not the comic. I really don't think you'll be dissapointed in any way with the condition of these comics. If so just tell me within 3 days and I'll refund your money.. minus shipping. I think that's a fair proposition. Trying to describe these as best I can so you'll know what you're getting before you bid. I haven't researched anything as to their true value.. I'll leave it to some savy bidders to do the research and bid accordingly. I'll start the bidding at $60 which I believe is a steal for this quality and quantity. I hate to set any limits at all but I feel 2 dollars a book is a pretty good buy.Sentimentally they're worth a lot more to me.. a part of my youth I held on to for all these years. You probably can't get that many brand new comics at that price. Much less true collector items. Anyways.. that's the deal. Hope you like what you see. Will accept PayPal, Money Orders, and Cashiers Check. Shipping will be a flat 7 dollars which will include: Well packed USPS Priority Shipping, Tracking # and insurance covering the total bid price. May cost more to do all this.. will be a fairly heavy package but I lean towards the buyer when it comes to shipping charges.

Today you can still find batik being done by the ethnic people in Guizhou Province, in the South-West of China. Here the Miao, Bouyei and Gejia people use a dye resist method that is different from the Han Chinese. The Miao place great emphasis on their costumes which are made up of decorative fabrics which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton (not silk) by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts, panels on jackets, aprons and baby carriers. Indigo is used chiefly for the basic cloth throughout Guizo to give dark blues. A paste is made from the harvested plants which have been soaked in a wooden barrel. Wax resisted fabric was probably one of the earliest forms of decoration in Guizhou as all the materials were at hand. Beeswax is the main ingredient but other resins or wax are possibly added. The wax resist never exploits crackle, the aim is to produce a clear image and beeswax is both tenacious and flexible. The wax is often heated in a little pot, resting in hot embers. Once applied the wax appears black on the fabric but at the end of the process the wax is removed from the fabric. The fabric is then rinsed in cool water and air dried. The beeswax can be reused. The usual tools for applying wax are of copper and brass with bamboo handles. They are made from 2 small triangular pieces of metal, their apexes bound to a bamboo holder by copper wire. It is held like a pen either upright or at a slant to the cloth which is laid flat on a board. This tool lends itself to the drawing of straight or slightly curving lines. The Miao, Gejia and Bouyei girls are highly skilled at batik. They use very finely drawn circular and double spiral designs representing the horns of the water buffalo, symbolising their ancestor's life and death. Girls start learning to produce batik from the age of 6 and 7 years. The finest work is found on baby carriers, sleeves of their jackets and skirts. The more traditional designs are geometric, where the most skilled wax resist reads as a fine blue line on a white ground. With the influence of the Han Chinese more figurative designs like flowers, birds, fish have been introduced over the centuries. This item is Dragon &amp; Phoenix (3) batik.Size:45 inches long and 45 inches wide.International shipping postage is 9 US $.Combine shipping postage can be reduced.BATIK CAN ONLY BE SENT ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

This group of X men are mostly warehouse copies.Also note that this scan generally will overstate defects (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan-nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said&quot;Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.(Any defect not revealed by the large scan will be discussed apart).The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist(similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to WHITE paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid ,with a LOW RESERVE(This low reserve allows our customers to use the buy it now feature.Many have missed out on previous books,and this feature usually prolongs the auction a bit longer to give everyone a chance to bid).As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1960 -1972.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition. We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel inventory is extensive and stocked in multiple conditions..Note.All our scans are &quot;High resolution&quot;.That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments?

Thanks very much for looking! just in time for christmas!! This is a beauty of a set! It is the: LENOX * HANCOCK GOLD * STAINLESS 5 PIECE PLACE SETTING!! BRAND NEW SET SKU #9862092!! RETAIL $120.00! This set is BRAND NEW! and each piece is individually wrapped and comes in the manufacturers packaging and box with all paperwork as if you had purchased it in the store. Included is a SALAD FORK, PLACE FORK, PLACE KNIFE, PLACE SPOON, and TEASPOON. The scan really is not that good as I just laid them on the scanner. You really cannot see the great detail in the gold accents, but trust me, its gorgeous. All pieces are new and flawless. Any lines, markes, dots, or imperfections seen are only from the scan and NOT the pieces. Please note that all the flatwear sets I offer on EBAY are NOT &quot;factory seconds&quot; nor are they &quot;factory recalls&quot;. EVERY set I sell are ORIGINAL AND AUTHENTIC and are the EXACT SAME items (same sku, model# etc..)as you would get if you purchased these in the finest stores. Because of my very low starting prices on these sets, I have had several emails inquiring about the authenticity of these settings. TRUST ME, these are the REAL DEAL, and you can verify them by taking them to any retailer to have them looked at. I have sold well over 250 premium flatwear sets in the last several months on EBAY so you can view my feedback for further assurance. I do not mean to dwell too long on this, but I know that there are alot of &quot;fake&quot; stuff offered so I just wanted to put your minds at ease. Nowback to the auction. This set sells for a minimum of $120.00 at Hetch's! Sure you may find it less than that at some warehouse type outlets, but I guarantee you won't find it cheaper than here! This is a very beautiful design and made by one of the BEST manufacturers of flatwear sets. Minimum is only $19.99 which is ridiculous. Someone will be very happy with this set. You should always have extra settings for unexpected guests, and this is an excellent and affordable way to obtain one without spending mucho money! Please view my flawless 600+ feedback and know that I am an honest and reputable seller. A lot of flatwear on EBAY are advertised as &quot;new condition&quot; but in reality has been in the seller's possession for quite some time. All my items are BRAND NEW and AUTHENTIC!! I HAVE 4 TOTAL SETS OF THIS PATTERN UP NOW ON EBAY IN CASE YOU NEED MORE! I also have other premium sets curretly up on EBAY, so please check them out. This item will be sent via Priority Mail for $4.50. Additional settings won, please add $1 per setting for combined S/H. Insurance extra if desired, although I have never had a problem with lost or damaged mail by Priority Mail. But it's your choice. I accept PayPal, checks, and MOs. Thanks again and HAPPY BIDDING!!

EACH panel measures approx. 80&quot; long (with a nice 3&quot; weighted hem), 26&quot; wide at the pinch pleated top, and 44&quot; at the bottom. Just some small areas of slight wear on the edges of a few of them, and they are no longer lined. The fabric is heavier in weight, with a nice nubby texture (similiar to barkcloth). These have recently been dry cleaned and are READY TO HANG to add vintage CHARM and sophistication to your home! If you don't need all 6 panels, you could recover a side chair, recover your dining room chairs or make matching pillows. You will LOVE these!

So far I have put up around 2000 comics and have had overwhelmingly great feedback (409 positive and 0 negative or neutral in the last month). I use ebay picture service for these auctions and many people have asked for better pictures. This is what ebay offers so if you have any questions about condition of a book, email before you bid. I am listing these comics for my 80 year old neighbors family. He recently passed away. There seems to be about twenty box and I will slowly list them all, so please keep looking. I have done some research on other auctions and people seem to price different comics differently and assign a grade. I do not know how to do this so I will start each auction at $1.00 and what you see is what you get. Please bid accordingly. All comics come in plastic bags and have cardboard boards so they are well protected. I will ship up to 5 comics priority mail for $5.00. Each 5 comics after that will be $1.10 more. I will not ship any other method as I cannot guarentee delivery with any other method. Please agree to this before bidding and do not request any other form of shipping I accept paypal, checks or money orders. Auctions must be paid for within ten days or negative feedback will be left. Anyone not satisfied with their comic may return it and I will refund the purchase price. Not the shipping so please look carefully at the scan and ask any questions first. Remember it is very important for you, the buyer, to ask any questions before you bid. I am doing the best I can to sell these at reasonable prices and I believe that any comic I list is at least worth $1.00.

I do not collect trivets, so any information I include here is only what was passed to me, as I can not claim any personal expertise in the area. This cast iron trivet is a nice match to another one of my listings with a single turtledove. This trivet has a heart handle with an iron stand shaped plate. The main body has a two headed turtle dove with a heart shaped body, flanked by two more hearts. It has been painted with PA Dutch / Amish styled accent colors of blue, green, red and yellow. Measures 8 1/4&quot; x 4&quot;. Rear markings: &quot;260&quot;. Revision... I was calling this bird a turtledove until I received an email from a friendly eBayer (thanks lenka!) informing me that this is not a turtledove, but rather the &quot;Mystical Distelfink with two heads so he is better able to watch more closely for evil to ward off and keep away from the distelfinks care giver. The farmer would also paint this bird on his barns to keep it and it's contents safe.&quot; That info got me curious and on the web site www.amishmarket.com, I found this description of a hex sign with a similar design: &quot;Double Eagle (Courage) A large, stylized double headed bird, a double headed eagle, is shown in this design. The eagle represents strength and courage. The trinity tulips add faith, hope and charity; the heart add love. This design symbolizes strength and courage.&quot; This trivet doesn't have the trinity tulip, but it does have the hearts, and the bird looks like the double headed eagle shown on the hex sign. So, it looks like it's not a turtledove afterall, but either an Eagle or a Distelfink (goldfinch)!

This old mold is in remarkable condition considering it's age. It doesn't look like it was ever used. On the inside of the mold, there was an old recipe card for &quot;Coconut Lamb Cake&quot;. The interesting thing is that most of the brands the recipe calls for are either no longer being made or are very old famous well used brands. For instance, &quot;Swans Down Cake Flour, Snow Frosting, and Calumet Baking Powder.&quot; The recipe card is dated 1921. The lamb mold measures 13 and 1/2&quot; in length by 8&quot; in height. This old mold looks as if it was a promotional item for The General Foods Corporation in the 1920's promoting Bakers Coconut. The mold also has &quot;Baker's Coconut&quot; embossed at the bottom beneath the Lamb. This is a great old piece of advertising, not to mention a wonderful collectible for the culinary person! This old Lamb mold would also just be a fabulous piece to display in a country kitchen. You also have the original old recipe card that came with the mold, so there's no excuse not to put this old mold to use!! Best of all NO RESERVE . Personal checks or money orders accepted. Checks must clear before shipping. We can accept Visa and MasterCard, but only via PayPal. All items sold as is, so please be sure to ask any questions before you bid.

Welcome to my auctions for this week! Yup...it's the original. Hulk #4, a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby classic! This is a Good/Good+ copy. It's got lots of wear, but is still a solid copy. Both staples are still well attached, as is the centerfold. The book has a slight spine roll. The best part about this book is that the pages are supple and a GORGEOUS and SOLID off-white, as are the inside front covers! There is NO sign of color unevenness at all! Nice! This is part of a large collection I bought a while back from Showcase-New-England, and this is what they graded it, I agree, so you can be doubly sure of grading! Overstreet Guide for this book is $140.00 H A P P Y H O L I D A Y S ! The Holidays are upon us! This is an EXCELLENT gift for the comic collector you know and love, or even yourself ! ALL items PAID FOR by December 17th are GUARANTEED to ship in time for Christmas if shipped Priority! Cool, huh? GRADING: I've been collecting and selling for over 11 years...I care about comics, and condition, and I grade according to Overstreet and CGC standards. I grade strictly because I know what it's like to spend good money on a book that I REALLY wanted, only to be really disappointed when it shows up two grades lower than advertised. So, please bid with confidence! SHIPPING: Shipping will be $4.50 (isn't that crazy?) for USPS Priority Mail, or $2.50 Special Standard (Book Rate). Price includes Delivery Confirmation for both, and insurance can also be purchased. All books are shipped in sturdy packages...no point in selling nice books, and then having them damaged in shipping! And always, shipping is combined for multiple auction wins. International Bidders : I will ship the books anywhere in the world, but it gets SPENDY! I try to ship everything via Global Priority ($9US to most countries), but please note, there may be exchange and bank fees involved. I'm not making extra money, just passing on what I get charged. PAYMENT: Please DO NOT PAY until I have contacted you! This is very important, as it has led to some confusion in the past. Thank you! Hey, check out my other auctions here: Grayson's Auctions! Enjoy! The Small Print: 1. I answer ALL e-mail questions as soon as I receive them, so please do not hesitate to ask! 2. Winning bidder notifications will be sent out within 24 hours of auction's end. PLEASE READ the entire note, and pay attention to all details therein. I cannot tell you how many times I've received payments with absolutely NO identification as to what it's for, and then folks get mad when their shipment is delayed! 3. I have had an inordinate amount of non-paying bidders lately. I'm a decent and honest person, but even I get frustrated when people take advantage of me. So please, if you're not going to pay, for whatever reason, please just don't bid. If something happens in between the auction's end, and you sending payment, please do not wait for ME to contact YOU. Communication is the KEY, and usually resolves problems! 4. I can only ship once a week, as I cannot get to the Post Office more than that. Please be patient when expecting your book(s)! 5. If, after you receive your item(s), you're not happy for ANY reason...please let me know! I have zero negatives because I take care of my customers. We can work out a solution that works for everyone, if it comes to that. My focus is the COLLECTOR looking for specific items, not dealers, or other wholesalers. I want everyone to be not just satisfied, but HAPPY with what they purchase! Happy customers are repeat customers! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

This was purchased in the 70's to go with the Antique Painted Finishes of Red, Blue, Gold and Green that Tell City featured on many items. It is pictured with the antique green and I could email you a photo of it with a gold Tell City item. Unfortunately, I do not have any red or blue finishes to photo it with. I seasonally change the upholstery on the Tell City upholstered chairs and cushioned rockers for variety. My local upholstery lady has adapted velcro to enable easy change out of the skirts. The cushioned rockers do not need any special adaptions. This 13 yards is enough to probably do at least 2 and maybe 3 Tell City chairs depending on which chairs you have. The fabric is 36 inches wide and is on a cardboard bolt. It has been in a smoke free environment. It appears to be cotton. It is difficult to find authentic fabric for the Young Republic Group in today's fabric store. The reserve is less than the per yard than the price of new cotton. $6.00 shipping for the 48 states. No handling fee on this easy to package item. Insurance extra at buyer's discretion. Payment within 10 days. The antique green bread peel is new old store stock from the same Tell City dealer and could be put on buy it now if any Ebayers are interested in it. It has the original tag and is MINT! Happy Holiday Greetings from our Home to Yours!

LOT OF TWO VINTAGE SHAVERS This auction is for two electric shavers. The first one is a Ronson that works and comes in a case. The other one is Sunbeam that also works and comes in a leather pouch. These would be nice to add to your collection. Please see shipping costs/methods and insurance requirements below. For larger items please click here to email us for a quote. All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. DELIVERY CAN BE MADE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF OUR STORE ON OUR LARGER ITEMS. PLEASE EMAIL FOR A DELIVERY QUOTE The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Buyer to pay $4.50 for shipping and handling. All international bidders MUST email us for an adjusted S&amp;H quote! . Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&amp;H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro

The tablecloth is 75 inches x 61 inches in size. I have no idea what kind of fabric the tablecloth is made from although I believe it is cotton or a cotton blend. You can see the texture of the fabric as it is not a fine weave fabric. The deep rich color of the fabric adds to the luxurious quality of this tablecloth. I am pretty sure the fabric is not permanent press as it does crease fairly easily. This beautiful tablecloth belonged to my Mother in Law. I have no idea how old it is. I believe she used it under her lace tablecloths (separate auctions) for added color. I am no expert. However, from what I can see, the tablecloth is in mint condition.

The mischevious smirk on the Pixie's face says it all. The pot is labeled Mustard and has yellow stripes on a white background. The lid is a pixie with spoon below for serving the mustard.

This is one of them. During the early 70's I looked forward, each week, to Jules Lenier's Talisman weekly. It was a small publication, printed on plain paper that contained some dynamite close up magic. It also contained Senatorial Observations by Clarke Crandall. No one ever forgot the Senator. I honestly don't remember how long this thing ran. The last issue I have is July 30, 1971. The first issue here is Number 14 - June 5, 1970. Lots of good reading and a rare item, I'm sure.

In 1986, a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm, revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again, with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It's been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and everything is just fine. Perfect, in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn't know is that it's a total sham. A perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears, once and for all. It's not gonna be pretty. But at least it'll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer, more streamlined, and with a vitality that hasn't been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully, he must first return to being the World's Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World's Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller's collaborator, Lynn Varley.

Would make a nice item if you don't want the kids to know what you're doing in your room at night. Or, you could give it to the kids and then you won't know what they're doing!

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

We accept the following payments: credit card payments through Billpoint and PayPal.com (same/next day shipping), electronic checks through Billpoint (usually 3 day wait for verification of funds before shipping), money orders (same/next day shipping) and checks (10 to 14 days before shipping to allow your check to clear). Your payment should reach us no later than 10 days after the close of this auction to guarantee your purchase.

So far, it_s been my experience that it_s not quite perfected. Unless you_ve used it and are delighted with it, please don_t click on checkout. When you click on it I get an email instructing me to send you an invoice. I_ve had several double payments as bidders think they must pay from it after they_ve already sent payment via paypal. Paypal is by far my favorite but Billpoint is also accepted. I_ll send an email when the auction finishes _ usually within the hour. On with the listing_. Today I'm listing vintage textiles. Most of these were purchased at estate auctions. Because of that, I have no accurate idea of the age. Unless stated otherwise, you can expect them to be used and possibly stained. I'll do my absolute best to describe stains and any damage. Any piece that shows more than 2 or 3 small holes goes into the _cutter_ pile and will be listed as such. It's never my intention to misrepresent an item. Textiles are so difficult to list because, I know as a buyer myself, they are nice to feel before buying. Also, any round white spots are probably camera lens spots. I_ll be happy to combine multiple wins to save on shipping costs. This tablecloth measures 56 x 76 inches. It has no staining - no holes. (We think the yellow napkins match - see my listing of dozens of napkins.) The color is a soft buttery yellow. If the cloth is turned upside down it's more like the napkins. I start all listings at $1.00 _ if possible. I know half of the fun of eBay is bidding (the other half is winning!). Email any questions before bidding. I reserve the right to reject bids from anyone with negative feedback regarding payment. Payment is requested within 10 days of the close of the auction _ please do not bid if you have no intention to buy. Iowa residents add 7% sales tax. Methods of payment accepted are money orders, credit cards using Paypal.com &amp; Billpoint, and I will accept personal checks _ if you have at least 10 positive payment feedbacks. High bidder to add $5.20 toward shipping (international bidders see next paragraph). This amount does NOT include insurance _ I_m trying to keep your costs down. Insurance can be requested on any auction ($1.10 for the first $50 of value). I am not responsible for uninsured items or items that the post office loses. I pack as carefully as possible but accidents can occur. I am disappointed when something I order breaks and know that you are too. I_ve been shipping items for over a year and Priority Mail is the most cost effective method. Other arrangements can be made by request - especially on books and paper items. I try to watch for those winning multiple auctions and will combine for shipping savings. I mail Monday through Friday and your package will go out the next trip after payment is received _ I will email you confirming this. Because of ongoing difficulties with the Sioux City UPS customer counter I can only UPS parcels via Mail Boxes Etc. If you are an international bidder (this includes Canadians) you will need to send me your postal code and I will get you a shipping amount (for surface and air) at that time. I will not sign a customs form declaring the contents are a gift. I must let you know that the US Postal Service has discontinued the small packet rate. Shipping has drastically increased _ even to Canada. What I thought would cost $4 to ship was increased to $14. If payment is not received the following feedback will be left _ _as promised _ negative feedback due to nonpaying bidder_. I was kind last year and burned a few times. If your payment will be delayed, please let me know - I understand things do happen. Thanks for taking the time to look and check out my other auctions for similar items! I accept US &amp; International bidders &amp; payment with a major credit card via B id P ay .

Profiles in History's Once in a Lifetime Experiences presents Dinner with Robert. H. Justman! What Star Trek fan wouldn't jump at the chance to spend an evening with one of the most beloved figures in Star Trek History? One very fortunate bidder will have that chance. The esteemed Mr. Justman needs no introduction to Star Trek fans, but here is an opportunity to spend a private evening with a true gentleman, a charming conversationalist, a genuine insider and a font of Star Trek knowledge, at one of the most &quot;in&quot; spots in LA - the famous Wolfgang Puck restaurant - Spago's Beverly Hills If you are the high bidder, you and a guest will be flown to Los Angeles where your personal Towncar awaits you. You will glide in luxury up the famous 405 freeway and down Sunset Boulevard, through Beverly Hills and into the heart of Hollywood, where your room at the grand old historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has been reserved. This is the true Grande Dame of Hollywood - the site of the first Academy Awards Presentation and the glamorous gathering place of the biggest stars in Motion Picture History. Here, you will have time to relax, and freshen up before you meet Mr. Justman and his gracious, elegant wife for dinner. Your Towncar will drive you to Spago's where the food is the exquisite and the clientele exclusive. This is a unique and very limited opportunity to ask the questions you've always wanted to ask, discuss the subjects you want to discuss - and experience the luxury of a private dinner with a Star Trek legend. Of course Jamie Lee Curtis or Billy Crystal just might be at the next table. But you'll probably be so engrossed in Mr. Justman's tales and anecdotes (not only of Star Trek but his many, many other shows) that you won't even notice. When your dinner is over - your Towncar awaits to return you to your hotel, or to explore LA Nightlife on your own. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is across from the Chinese Theater, convenient to Universal Studios, the Sunset Strip, and other major attractions, and only one block from the brand new entertainment &amp; shopping Complex, Hollywood and Highland! Be the first to go where no fan has gone before - into the private life of this distinguished and beloved repository of Star Trek lore. This item is one of more than 500 pieces of Star Trek memorabilia, all from the collection of Star Trek Art Director Matt Jefferies, Executive in Charge of Production Herb Solow and Producer Bob Justman. Our highlight items - over 300 - will be auctioned off live on December 12, 2001 at 2:00 pm PST.
