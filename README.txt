I WOULD LIKE TO ENTER THE AUCTIONBASE CONTEST

1. Manually Change the current time:
Click on Time Machine on the upper right corner

2. Ability to bid
Open any "open" item and click on Bid Now, and follow the form instructions.

3. Automatic auction closing.
Bid the buy price of a particular item or change the time using the time machine and the auction will close.

4. Ability to see the winner of an auction
Closed auctions will show the winners. Open any closed auctions by clicking on the item's name link

5. Search
Search any item from the top search bar. Input parameters possible - "keyword, price, buy price, status" and any combination of these. 

6. Ability to find an (open or closed) auction based on itemid
This usually not a user scenario since they don't deal with IDs. But for the project, you can visit: item.php/?itemid=<itemid>
