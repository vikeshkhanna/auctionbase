I WOULD LIKE TO ENTER THE AUCTIONBASE CONTEST

1. Manually Change the current time:
Click on Time Machine on the upper right corner. The current time is available there, as well as in the footer. 

2. Ability to bid
Open any "open" item and click on Bid Now, and follow the form instructions.

3. Automatic auction closing.
Bid the buy price of a particular item or change the time using the time machine and the auction will close. Note that auctions that haven't started yet are considered "Closed" as per definition and no action is allowed on them. 

4. Ability to see the winner of an auction
Closed auctions will show the winners. Open any closed auctions by clicking on the item's name link

5. Search
Search any item from the top search bar. Input parameters possible - "keyword, price, buy price, status" and any combination of these. 

6. Ability to find an (open or closed) auction based on itemid
This is usually not a user scenario since they don't deal with IDs. But for the project, you can visit: item.php/?itemid=<itemid>

Extra functionality:
1. Very easy to use interface. 
2. The items page shows lots of stastics, like number of bids, current bid, other items from seller, similar items, number of likes (all zero for now).
3. The user page shows stats of a user, like number of auctions, number of bids, highest bid. It also lists all the auctions and bids they have participated in.
4. The search page is highly optimized and user-friendly. It supports pagination with AJAX-based fetching, sorting by three ways (Popularity, price - low to high, price - high to low), filtering based on price, buy price, status etc. It also supports category zoom-in. Clickin on a category with only load items from that category.
